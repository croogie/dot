# Dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files for all frequently used
terminal tools like nvim, tmux, zsh etc.

This file most probably should be updated in some time but for now let's 
describe most important thingsâ€¦

## Installation

Checkout this repository into `.dotfiles` in your home directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/croogie/dot ~/.dotfiles --recursive
```

Depending on which system you're installing execute either `./macos` or `./unix` 
scripts to perform installation and proper configuration of everything.

So far please keep in mind that any required software has to be installed
manually (will figure it out later).
